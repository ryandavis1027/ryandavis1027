# About me


**ryandavis1027/ryandavis1027** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working with the Birtwistle Lab to help in developing a whole cell model, based on the individual rate laws governing each reaction occuring inside the cell.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Weird things I like: Pledge furniture polish, the smell of a freshly vacuumed room, and Fireball candies.
